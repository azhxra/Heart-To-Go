# Heart-To-Go
Heart To Go is a website with photos and descriptions of destinations all around the world.
The header is made sticky for users to simply return on top faster when they are at the bottom already.
The footer isn't because then it will look like a frame.
In the About Me section, the photo is round and small because it is not that necessary.
For the socials, it is inside the logos of each platforms, because it just make sense and more aesthetic.
Finally, the Contact section is just simple because we alreqady had a lot going on on top.
